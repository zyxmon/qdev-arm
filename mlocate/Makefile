define Package/mlocate/description
 Quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from cron.
